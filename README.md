# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a second year student (BSc. Math) at SRMKTR. 
### And a âœ¨ _proud_ âœ¨ student enrolled in IITM's online BSc. (DS & Programming) program.

##### I'm very proficient in python, and have a good foundation on basic ML and other predictive analysis methods (Andrew Ng coursera).
##### However I lack the experience in implementing this knowledge on DS & ML projects. I'm wandering Kaggle hoping to acquire this experience.
##### Please feel free to contact me for collaborating on such projects; I'd greatly appreciate it. Such an exposure with other partners is what I'm striving for to improve my skills. Check out my detailed DS portfolio here (hyperlink coming soon)

###### For 2 years I've been meaning to explore this platform to the fullest. Thanks to devdays for finally pushing me to start githubifying :)
